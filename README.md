# ProjectTB3
This is the github repository of a Project that has the goal to give good places to store food. 

# Frontend
As the name suggest, this file is where the website is stored, you can check the code that was modified in the files main.html, recipy.html and location.html. This is where all of the code was written for the frontend part. The individual sections are separated and all the VueJs is done in the location.html file. Normally, the method names are quite explicit. 

# Arduino 
This is where the script for the ESP32 lies. As our chip did not work anymore, we have no guarantee that our code works but the code does look correct to us and we understand what it does. Again, the code is quite explicit as every function in the libraries we used have very explicit names and only one comment was added as a line was not very clear (the wifi initialisation).
